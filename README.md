# triplineJS
TriplineJS allows you to write t.dgebtn instead of document.getElementByTagName, and a whole lot of other cool things, so, what are you waiting for?! 

# How do I start?
Crack open tripline.js to see the functions currently added, fork it, add more functions, sumbit a pull request, and get your changes accepted. After 5 changes accepted, you get commit access.

# Current roadmap
* Add Array functions, and a function that adds them to the array object
* Make sure all document and window functions are supported
* Get some more examples (very important)
* Fix bugs, and report bugs by emailing me at dhaivatpandya@gmail.com
